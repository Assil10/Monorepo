What I asked DeepSeel-Reasoner(R1)
Here is your task  :

you have 3 repositories :  eng, frensh,arabic .

In each repositry we have text files that contain answers from a code that I wrote .

The code used different LLm to generate an answer for 3 queries using Rag .

That means for each query we have an answer from a different LLM

The name of the LLM is in the begining of the file name before _response  , for exemple for the file name = "gemini-1.5-flash-001_response_query0_ar " the model name is gemini-1.5-flash-001 .

For each query we have a text file that contain the document retrieved ( the document retrieved is the document that the llm uses to generate an answer )

file names structure : retrieved_documents_query0 , retrieved_documents_query1 , retrieved_documents_query2

let's take the mode: gemini-1.5-flash for exemple

The responses related in arabic repository  :

1-gemini-1.5-flash_response_query0_ar

2-gemini-1.5-flash_response_query1_ar

3-gemini-1.5-flash_response_query2_ar

The document retrieved :

1-ar_retrieved_documents_query0

2-ar_retrieved_documents_query1

3-ar_retrieved_documents_query2

Task to do :

1-Compare each model respons to the document retrieved, did it sucessfuly take the informations and generated a humain readable response without removing , adding extra informations , if it didn't elimnate it .

And important to compare the language of the document and the llm response , if the llm response language is different than the documenet elimnate it

2- Compare the llms responses to each other and give me the best LLM.

for exemple for query 0 :

u read retrieved_documents_query0 and see if  gemini-1.5-flash succesfuly generated an answer in the gemini-1.5-flash_response_query0 file

do that again for all llms

and than compare their result to each other

do that for all queries ( qiuery 0 , query 1 , query 2 )

3-In the end generate a file named llms_analysis where you give me top 3 llms that gave the best answer , and tell me why you choose them over the others

Important : each repository is seperated from the other , so for exemple you start with the arabic repository , after you finish you open the frensh repository , and than the eng repository .

Respond with details analysis no code , and save them to file anmed llms_analysis.text
