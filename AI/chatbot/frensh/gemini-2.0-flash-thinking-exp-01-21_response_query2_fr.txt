To develop real estate in Tunisia, several permits and authorizations are necessary at different stages of the project.  For planning and design, an urban planning permit from local authorities is required to validate the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs must also be approved, certified by accredited professionals, and comply with construction and environmental standards.

For licenses and construction, a building permit from the municipality or relevant authority is needed after project approval. This permit approves plans and ensures compliance with construction rules. Regular quality control inspections may be necessary during construction to guarantee conformity with legal standards and specifications.

Regarding environmental standards, certain projects may require an environmental impact assessment to evaluate the impact on the local environment and necessitate approval from environmental authorities.

Special licenses may be needed for specific projects such as commercial or industrial developments, obtained from relevant organizations like the Ministry of Industry or Commerce.

For land subdivision projects, authorizations are required from competent authorities, including the municipality and the land management office.

Finally, after construction, a certificate of conformity from local authorities is necessary to confirm that the construction meets the requirements of the permit and the law.
