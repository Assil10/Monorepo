Developing real estate in Tunisia requires several permits and authorizations.

First, a planning permit (Permis d'urbanisme) is needed from local authorities before any project begins. This includes approval of the project's plan and design, ensuring compliance with urban planning laws.

Following this, architectural and engineering projects, certified by qualified professionals, must be submitted for design approval. This approval verifies adherence to construction standards, codes, and environmental regulations.

Once the design is approved, a building permit (Permis de construire) is required from the municipality or relevant authority. This includes plan approval and adherence to construction rules.

Certain projects, such as commercial or industrial developments, may necessitate special licenses from organizations like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce.

If the project involves subdividing land, authorizations must be obtained from the municipality and the land management office.

Finally, upon completion of construction, a certificate of conformity (Certificat de conformit√©) is required from local authorities, confirming that the construction meets the requirements of the permit and the law.
