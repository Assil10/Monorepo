Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to a series of legal and administrative requirements designed to regulate the process and ensure compliance with local laws. Developers must consult with legal and technical experts to ensure all requirements are met and necessary permits are obtained.  Compliance with these requirements can help avoid legal issues and expedite the development process. 

Here are the administrative procedures to follow:

**Project Planning and Design:**

* **Urban Planning Permit:** Before starting any real estate development project, it is necessary to obtain a permit from local authorities. This permit includes approval of the project's plan and design in accordance with urban planning laws.
* **Design Approval:** Architectural and engineering projects, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval. Designs must comply with construction standards, codes, and environmental regulations.

**Licenses and Construction:**

* **Building Permit:** Following project approval, a building permit must be obtained from the municipality or the relevant authority. This permit includes approval of the plans and adherence to construction regulations.
* **Quality Controls:** During the construction phase, periodic inspections may be required to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Land Law Compliance:**

* **Property Verification:** Ensure that the land used for the project is legally owned and duly registered in the land registry. This may require providing property documents and legal confirmations.
* **Property Rights Settlement:** If the land has co-ownership or disputed rights, these issues must be resolved before starting development.

**Environmental Standards:**

* **Environmental Impact Assessment:** For certain projects, an environmental impact study may be required to assess their impact on the local environment. This study may require approval from environmental authorities.

**Special Licenses and Permits:**

* **Special Licenses:** Certain projects, such as commercial or industrial developments, may require specific licenses from relevant agencies, such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce.
* **Safety Standards Compliance:** Adherence to safety and public health regulations is necessary, including the installation of security and fire protection systems.

**Taxes and Fees:**

* **Permit and License Fees:** Fees related to obtaining permits and licenses may apply and must be paid according to local regulations.
* **Development Taxes:** There may be taxes or fees related to development, such as improvement charges or land taxes.

**Property Registration After Development:**

* **Land Registry Registration:** Once construction is completed, the property must be registered in the land registry. This requires submitting documents proving that the project was carried out in accordance with legal specifications.
* **Certificate of Conformity:** Obtaining a certificate of conformity from local authorities confirms that the construction meets the permit and legal requirements.

**Compliance of Land Subdivisions:**

* **Subdivision:** If the project involves subdividing a piece of land into multiple plots, necessary authorizations must be obtained from the relevant authorities, including the municipality and the land management office.
