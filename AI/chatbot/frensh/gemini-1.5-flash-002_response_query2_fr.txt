To develop real estate in Tunisia, you need the following permits and authorizations:

* **Urban planning permit:** Obtained from local authorities before starting the project, it approves the plan and design according to urban planning laws.
* **Design approval:** Architectural and engineering plans, certified by licensed professionals, must be approved. Designs must meet building codes, standards, and environmental regulations.
* **Building permit:** Obtained from the municipality or competent authority after project approval, it approves the plans and ensures compliance with building regulations.
* **Special licenses:** Required for certain projects (commercial or industrial) from relevant bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or Commerce.
* **Subdivision permits:** If the project involves subdividing land, authorizations are needed from the municipality and the land management office.

Additionally, verifying ownership and settling property rights are necessary before development begins.  An environmental impact study, with approval from environmental authorities, is required for some projects. Finally, registration with the land registry and obtaining a certificate of conformity are necessary after construction.
