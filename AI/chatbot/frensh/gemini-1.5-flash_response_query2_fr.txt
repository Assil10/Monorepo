To develop real estate in Tunisia, you need the following permits and authorizations:

* **Urban planning permit:** Obtained from local authorities before starting the project, it approves the project's plan and design according to urban planning laws.
* **Design approval:** Architectural and engineering plans, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval and comply with building codes, standards, and environmental regulations.
* **Building permit:** Obtained from the municipality or competent authority after project approval; it approves the plans and ensures compliance with building regulations.
* **Special licenses:** Required for certain projects (commercial or industrial) from competent bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or Commerce.
* **Subdivision permits:** If the project involves subdividing land into plots, authorizations are needed from the municipality and the land management office.

Furthermore, you must verify land ownership and resolve any land disputes before development begins.  Environmental impact studies may be required. Finally, registering the property with the land registry and obtaining a certificate of conformity are necessary after construction.
