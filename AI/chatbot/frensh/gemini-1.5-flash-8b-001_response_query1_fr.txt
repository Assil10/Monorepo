Tunisian real estate development requires meeting various legal and administrative requirements.  These include obtaining a zoning permit, design approval, a building permit, and periodic inspections during construction.  Property verification, resolving property rights, an environmental impact assessment (for some projects), special licenses (for some projects), payment of permit and license fees, development taxes, registration in the land registry, and obtaining a certificate of compliance are also necessary.  If the project involves a subdivision, specific authorizations from the relevant authorities are required.
