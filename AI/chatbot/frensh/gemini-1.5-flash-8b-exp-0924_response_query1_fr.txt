Tunisian real estate development requires adherence to various legal and administrative requirements.  These include obtaining a zoning permit, design approval, a building permit, and quality controls during construction.  Verifying land ownership, resolving property rights, assessing environmental impact (if necessary), obtaining any necessary special licenses, meeting safety standards, paying permit and license fees, and development taxes are also needed.  Finally, registration in the land registry and a certificate of compliance are required after construction, as well as subdivision approvals if the project involves dividing the land.
