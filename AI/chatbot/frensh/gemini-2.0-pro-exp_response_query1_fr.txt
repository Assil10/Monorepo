Administrative procedures for a real estate project in Tunisia involve the following steps:

1.  **Planning and Design:**
    *   Obtain an urban planning permit from local authorities, including approval of the plan and design according to urban planning laws.
    *   Submit architectural and engineering plans, certified by licensed professionals, for approval, ensuring they comply with building standards, codes, and environmental regulations.

2.  **Licenses and Construction:**
    *   Secure a building permit from the municipality or relevant authority once the project is approved.
    *   Undergo periodic inspections during construction to ensure adherence to legal standards and specifications.

3.  **Compliance with Land Laws:**
    *   Perform a property verification to confirm legal ownership and registration in the land registry; this may require title deeds and legal confirmations.
    *   Settle any property rights issues if the land is co-owned or disputed.

4.  **Environmental Standards:**
    *   Conduct an environmental impact assessment if the project requires it, and secure approval from environmental authorities.

5.  **Special Licenses and Permits:**
    *   Obtain specific licenses from relevant agencies (like the Ministry of Industry or Ministry of Commerce) for certain project types, such as commercial or industrial developments.
    *   Ensure compliance with safety and public health standards, including installing security and fire protection systems.

6.  **Taxes and Fees:**
    *   Pay all required permit and license fees as per local regulations.
    *   Settle any development-related taxes or charges, such as improvement fees or property taxes.

7.  **After Development:**
    *   Register the completed property with the land registry by submitting documentation that proves the project's legal compliance.
    *   Obtain a certificate of conformity from the local authorities.

8.  **Land Subdivision (if applicable):**
    *   Secure the necessary authorizations from the relevant authorities (such as the municipality or land management office) if the project involves dividing a plot of land.

Developers should consult with legal and technical experts to ensure all these requirements are met.
