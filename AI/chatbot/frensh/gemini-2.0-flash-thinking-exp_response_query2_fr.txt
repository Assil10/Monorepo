To develop real estate in Tunisia, you need several permits and authorizations.  For project planning and design, a planning permit is required from local authorities to approve the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs must also be approved to ensure they meet construction and environmental standards.

For licenses and construction, a building permit is necessary from the municipality or relevant authority after project approval. This permit covers plan approval and adherence to building regulations.

Specific projects like commercial or industrial developments may require special licenses from relevant bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or Commerce.

If your project involves subdividing land, authorizations are needed from authorities including the municipality and the land management office for land parcelling.

After construction, a certificate of compliance must be obtained from local authorities to confirm the construction meets permit and legal requirements.
