Tunisian real estate development requires adherence to a series of legal and administrative requirements.  These include obtaining a land use permit, design approval, a building permit, and construction quality checks.  Property verification, resolving property rights, environmental impact assessments (for some projects), special licenses (for some projects), payment of permit and license fees, and development taxes are also necessary.  After construction, registration with the land registry and obtaining a certificate of compliance are required.  If the project involves a subdivision, specific authorizations from the relevant authorities are needed.
