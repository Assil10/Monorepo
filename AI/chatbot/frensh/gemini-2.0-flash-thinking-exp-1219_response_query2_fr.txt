To develop real estate in Tunisia, several permits and authorizations are necessary, generally grouped by project stage.

**Project Planning and Design:**
A planning permit is needed before starting any project. This is obtained from local authorities and includes approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering project designs must be approved, with certified designs from licensed professionals that comply with construction and environmental standards.

**Licenses and Construction:**
A building permit is obtained from the municipality or relevant authority after project approval. This covers plan approval and adherence to building regulations.  During construction, periodic quality control inspections may be required to ensure compliance with legal standards.

**Special Licenses and Permits:**
Specific projects like commercial or industrial developments might require special licenses from relevant organizations such as the Ministry of Industry or Commerce.

**Property Registration After Development:**
A certificate of conformity is obtained from local authorities after construction to confirm the building meets the permit and legal requirements.

**Land Subdivision Compliance:**
If a project involves subdividing land, authorizations from relevant authorities, including the municipality and the land management office, are necessary.

Permit and license fees are applicable and must be paid according to local regulations. It is recommended to consult legal and technical experts to ensure all requirements are met and the necessary permits are obtained.
