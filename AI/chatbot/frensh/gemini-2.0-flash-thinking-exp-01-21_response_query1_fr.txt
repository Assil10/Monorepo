The administrative procedures for a real estate project in Tunisia are as follows:

**Project Planning and Design:**
First, obtain a Planning Permit from local authorities. This includes getting approval for the project plan and design, ensuring they comply with urban planning laws.  Submit architectural and engineering designs, certified by accredited professionals, for design approval. This step verifies compliance with construction and environmental standards.

**Licenses and Construction:**
Next, secure a Building Permit from the municipality or relevant authority after project approval. This requires plan approvals and adherence to building regulations. During construction, undergo periodic quality controls to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Land Law Compliance:**
Verify the ownership of the land intended for the project.  Ensure it is legally owned and registered in the land registry, which may involve providing property documents and legal confirmations. Settle any property rights issues if the land has co-ownership or contested rights before starting development.

**Environmental Standards:**
For certain projects, conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment to evaluate the project's effects on the local environment. This might require approval from environmental authorities.

**Special Licenses and Permits:**
Obtain special licenses from relevant bodies like the Ministry of Industry or Commerce for specific projects, such as commercial or industrial developments. Ensure compliance with safety and public health standards, including installing safety and fire protection systems.

**Taxes and Fees:**
Pay permit and license fees associated with obtaining these documents as per local regulations.  Settle development taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes.

**Post-Development Property Registration:**
After construction is complete, register the property in the land registry. Submit documents proving the project was built according to legal specifications. Obtain a Certificate of Conformity from local authorities, confirming the construction meets permit and legal requirements.

**Land Subdivision Compliance:**
If the project involves dividing land into multiple plots (subdivision), obtain necessary authorizations from relevant authorities, including the municipality and the land management office.
