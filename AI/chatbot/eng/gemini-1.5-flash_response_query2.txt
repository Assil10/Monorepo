Obtaining a planning permit from local authorities is necessary before starting any real estate development.  This requires approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval and comply with building codes and environmental standards.

After design approval, a building permit is needed from the municipality. This involves plan approval and adherence to building regulations.  Periodic inspections during construction may be required to ensure compliance.

Verify legal ownership and proper registration of the land in the land registry, providing necessary property documents and legal confirmations.  Resolve any joint ownership or disputes before development begins.

Some projects require an environmental impact assessment approved by environmental authorities.  Commercial or industrial projects may need specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or Commerce.  Safety and public health regulations must be followed, including safety and fire protection systems.

Pay permit and license fees according to local regulations, and be aware of potential development taxes or fees (improvement fees or property taxes).

Upon completion, register the property in the land registry, providing documents proving completion according to legal specifications.  Obtain a compliance certificate from local authorities confirming the construction meets permit and legal requirements.

If the project involves land subdivision, approvals from the municipality and land management office are required.

Government regulations include adherence to the Land Use and Urban Planning Law, governing urban planning and land development.  The Environmental Protection Law ensures compliance with environmental standards.  A building permit is required, involving plan review for compliance with urban and architectural regulations.  Major projects may need an environmental license assessing environmental impact.  Local authorities' guiding plans define land use.  Large-scale projects may require impact studies covering environmental, social, and economic effects.  Local authorities monitor construction with periodic inspections, including environmental inspections to ensure compliance with waste management, eco-friendly materials, and resource protection standards.  Large projects may need financial guarantees or securities.  Permit fees, property taxes, and public service charges apply.
