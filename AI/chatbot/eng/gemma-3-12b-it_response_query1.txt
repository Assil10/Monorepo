Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to legal and administrative requirements. Developers should consult legal and engineering experts throughout the process.

**Project Planning and Design:** A planning permit is needed from local authorities, including approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval, complying with building codes and environmental standards.

**Licensing and Construction:** A building permit must be obtained from the municipality or relevant authority, with plans approved and building regulations followed. Periodic quality inspections may be required during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Land Laws:** Verify the land's legal ownership and proper registration in the land registry, providing property documents and legal confirmations. Resolve any joint ownership or disputed land rights before development begins.

**Environmental Standards:** An environmental impact assessment may be required for some projects to evaluate their effect on the local environment.

**Special Licenses and Permits:** Certain projects, like commercial or industrial developments, may require specific licenses from bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations is necessary, including installing safety and fire protection systems.

**Taxation and Fees:** Permit and licensing fees apply and must be paid according to local regulations. Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, may also be required.

**Post-Development Property Registration:** Upon completion, the property must be registered in the land registry, submitting documents proving completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities confirming adherence to permit and legal requirements must also be obtained.

**Land Subdivision:** If the project involves land subdivision, necessary approvals must be obtained from relevant authorities, including the municipality and land management office.
