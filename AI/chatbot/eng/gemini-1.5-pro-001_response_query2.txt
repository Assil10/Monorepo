Obtaining a planning permit from local authorities is essential before starting any real estate development. This permit involves getting the project plan and design approved according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval. These designs must adhere to building codes and environmental standards.

After obtaining design approval, a building permit must be secured from the municipality or relevant authority. This permit covers the approval of plans and adherence to building regulations. Throughout the construction phase, periodic inspections may be necessary to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

Some projects may necessitate an environmental impact assessment to gauge their impact on the local environment. This assessment may require approval from environmental authorities.

Certain projects, like commercial or industrial developments, may require special licenses from relevant bodies, such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce.  Compliance with safety and public health regulations, including installing safety and fire protection systems, is mandatory.
