Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to specific legal and administrative requirements. It’s advisable to consult legal and engineering experts to ensure full compliance and obtain necessary permits, which can help avoid legal issues and speed up the process.

Before construction begins, a planning permit is needed from local authorities, approving the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must then be submitted for approval, ensuring they meet building codes and environmental standards. 

Following design approval, a building permit from the municipality is required, confirming adherence to building regulations. Throughout construction, periodic quality inspections may be necessary to verify compliance with legal standards.

It’s crucial to verify legal ownership and proper registration of the land in the land registry, providing necessary documentation. Any joint ownership or disputes regarding the land must be resolved before development starts.

Depending on the project, an environmental impact assessment may be required and must be approved by environmental authorities. Certain developments, like commercial or industrial projects, may also need specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce, and must comply with safety and public health regulations, including fire protection systems.

Permit and licensing fees, as well as development-related taxes (like improvement or property taxes), must be paid according to local regulations.

After construction, the property must be registered in the land registry with documentation proving completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities confirms the construction meets all requirements. 

If the project involves land subdivision, approvals from the municipality and land management office are also necessary.
