Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to various legal standards and permits. Before starting any project, a planning permit is needed from local authorities, including approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval and must comply with building codes and environmental standards. 

After design approval, a building permit is required from the municipality or relevant authority, encompassing plan approval and adherence to building regulations. Periodic quality inspections may be needed during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

For certain projects, an environmental impact assessment may be required to evaluate its effect on the local environment. This assessment may need approval from environmental authorities.

Specific projects, such as commercial or industrial developments, may require special licenses from relevant bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Safety and public health regulations are mandatory, including the installation of safety and fire protection systems.

Upon completion of construction, the property must be registered in the land registry. This requires submitting documents proving the project's completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities confirming that the construction meets the permit and legal requirements is also necessary.

If the project involves subdividing land into multiple plots, necessary approvals must be obtained from relevant authorities, including the municipality and land management office.
