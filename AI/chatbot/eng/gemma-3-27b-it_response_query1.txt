Property development in Tunisia requires adherence to several regulations. Project planning begins with obtaining a Planning Permit from local authorities, based on approved project plans and designs that align with urban planning laws. These plans and designs, certified by licensed professionals, must also meet building codes and environmental standards.

Construction itself requires a Building Permit from the municipality, ensuring compliance with building regulations, and is subject to Quality Inspections throughout the process. 

Legal ownership of the land must be verified through the land registry, with all necessary documents provided. Any issues regarding joint ownership or property disputes must be resolved before development begins.

Depending on the project, an Environmental Impact Assessment may be required and must be approved by environmental authorities. Certain developments, like commercial or industrial projects, necessitate Special Licenses from bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or Ministry of Commerce. Safety Compliance, including fire protection and safety systems, is also mandatory.

Developers must pay Permit and Licensing Fees, as well as Development Taxes like improvement or property taxes. 

Upon completion, the property must be registered in the land registry with proof of legal compliance, and a Compliance Certificate from local authorities confirming adherence to regulations must be obtained. 

If the project involves land subdivision, approvals from the municipality and land management office are also necessary.
