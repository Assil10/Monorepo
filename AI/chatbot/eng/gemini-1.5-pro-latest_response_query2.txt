Obtaining a planning permit from local authorities is necessary before any real estate development begins. This permit approves the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval and must comply with building codes and environmental standards.

A building permit must be obtained from the municipality or relevant authority after design approval. This permit covers the approved plans and adherence to building regulations. Periodic inspections may be required during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

The land used for the project must be legally owned and properly registered in the land registry.  Any joint ownership or disputes related to the land must be resolved before development begins.

Some projects require an environmental impact assessment to evaluate their effect on the local environment, which may need approval from environmental authorities.

Certain projects, such as commercial or industrial developments, may require specific licenses from relevant bodies. Compliance with safety and public health regulations is mandatory.

Fees for obtaining permits and licenses apply and must be paid according to local regulations. Development-related taxes or fees may also exist.

Upon completion of construction, the property must be registered in the land registry. A compliance certificate from local authorities confirms that the construction meets permit and legal requirements.

If the project involves subdividing land into multiple plots, necessary approvals must be obtained from relevant authorities.
