A planning permit, approving the project plan and design according to urban planning laws, is required before starting any development.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be approved and comply with building codes and environmental standards.

After design approval, a building permit, approving plans and adherence to building regulations, is obtained from the municipality or relevant authority.  Periodic quality inspections during construction may be required to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

Proof of legal ownership and proper land registry registration is necessary. Any joint ownership or disputes regarding property rights must be resolved before development begins.

An environmental impact assessment may be required for some projects and needs approval from environmental authorities.

Specific licenses, such as those from the Ministry of Industry or Commerce, may be needed for commercial or industrial developments.  Safety and public health regulations, including safety and fire protection systems, must be adhered to.

Fees for permits and licenses must be paid.  Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, may also apply.

Post-construction, land registry registration requires documents proving completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities confirming compliance with permits and legal requirements is also needed.

If the project involves subdividing land, approvals from the municipality and land management office are necessary.
