**Project Planning And Design**

To start a real estate project in Tunisia, you first need a planning permit from local authorities. This confirms your project plan and design meet urban planning laws. You must also submit architectural and engineering designs for approval. These need to be certified by licensed professionals and follow building codes and environmental standards.

**Licensing And Construction**

Once your designs are approved, get a building permit from the municipality or the relevant authority. This confirms your plans follow building regulations. During construction, expect periodic inspections to check that work meets legal standards and project specifications.

**Compliance With Land Laws**

Verify the project land is legally owned and correctly registered in the land registry. You might need to show property documents and legal confirmations. If the land has multiple owners or ownership is disputed, resolve these issues before starting development.

**Environmental Standards**

Some projects require an environmental impact assessment to check their effect on the local environment. Environmental authorities may need to approve this assessment.

**Special Licenses And Permits**

Specific projects, like commercial or industrial ones, might need special licenses from bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. You must also comply with safety and public health rules, which includes installing safety and fire protection systems.

**Taxation And Fees**

Expect to pay fees for permits and licenses as required by local regulations. Development might also involve taxes or fees, like improvement fees or property taxes.

**Property Registration Post-Development**

After construction is finished, register the property in the land registry. You'll need documents showing the project was completed according to legal specifications. Get a compliance certificate from local authorities to confirm the construction followed the permit and legal rules.

**Land Subdivision Compliance**

If your project involves dividing land into multiple plots, get the necessary approvals from relevant authorities, including the municipality and the land management office.
