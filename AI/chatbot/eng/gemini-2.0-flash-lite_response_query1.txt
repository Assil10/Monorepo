*   Periodic inspections during construction are necessary to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Compliance with Land Laws:**

*   The land used for the project must be legally owned and properly registered in the land registry, potentially requiring property documents and legal confirmations.
*   Any joint ownership or disputed rights must be resolved before development begins.

**Environmental Standards:**

*   Some projects may require an environmental impact assessment to evaluate their environmental effects, which may need approval from environmental authorities.

**Special Licenses and Permits:**

*   Certain projects, such as commercial or industrial developments, may need specific licenses from relevant bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce.
*   Compliance with safety and public health regulations, including the installation of safety and fire protection systems, is mandatory.

**Taxation and Fees:**

*   Fees related to obtaining permits and licenses must be paid according to local regulations.
*   Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, must be paid.

**Property Registration Post-Development:**

*   The property must be registered in the land registry upon construction completion, requiring documentation proving the project's legal completion.

**Land Subdivision Compliance:**

*   If the project involves subdividing land, necessary approvals must be obtained from the municipality and land management office.
