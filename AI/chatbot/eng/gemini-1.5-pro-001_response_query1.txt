Obtaining a Planning Permit from local authorities is mandatory before starting any real estate development. This permit approves the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval, ensuring compliance with building codes and environmental standards. 

After design approval, a Building Permit from the municipality or relevant authority is required. This permit approves the construction plans and ensures adherence to building regulations. The project may undergo periodic inspections during construction to enforce compliance with legal standards and specifications.

The land designated for the project must have clear legal ownership and be correctly registered in the land registry. Providing property documents and legal confirmations may be necessary. Any joint ownership or disputes related to the land must be resolved before development begins.

An environmental impact assessment may be necessary to evaluate the project's potential effects on the local environment. This assessment might require approval from environmental authorities.

Specific projects, like commercial or industrial developments, may require specialized licenses from relevant bodies, such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations, including the installation of safety and fire protection systems, is essential.

Fees for obtaining permits and licenses are applicable and must be paid as per local regulations. Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, might also apply.

Upon construction completion, the property must be registered in the land registry. This requires submitting documents that prove the project's adherence to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities, confirming the construction meets all permit and legal requirements, is also necessary.

If the project involves subdividing land into multiple plots, approvals from relevant authorities, including the municipality and land management office, are mandatory.
