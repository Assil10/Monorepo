**Project Planning And Design**

A planning permit from local authorities is required before starting any real estate development. This permit approves the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, need approval and must meet building codes and environmental standards.

**Licensing And Construction**

Following design approval, a building permit is needed from the municipality or the relevant authority, confirming plan approval and compliance with building regulations. Periodic quality inspections may occur during construction to check adherence to legal standards and specifications.

**Compliance With Land Laws**

Verify that the project land is legally owned and correctly registered in the land registry; property documents and legal confirmations might be needed. Any joint ownership or disputes over land rights must be settled before development begins.

**Environmental Standards**

Certain projects might require an environmental impact assessment to evaluate effects on the local environment, potentially needing approval from environmental authorities.

**Special Licenses And Permits**

Specific projects, like commercial or industrial ones, may need special licenses from bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Safety and public health regulations must be followed, including installing safety and fire protection systems.

**Taxation And Fees**

Fees for permits and licenses may be applicable and must be paid as per local rules. Development might also incur taxes or fees, like improvement fees or property taxes.

**Property Registration Post-Development**

Once construction is finished, the property must be registered in the land registry. This involves submitting documents showing the project met legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities is needed to confirm the construction met permit and legal requirements.

**Land Subdivision Compliance**

If the project includes subdividing land into multiple plots, approvals are required from authorities like the municipality and the land management office.
