Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to legal and administrative requirements to ensure compliance with local laws. Developers are advised to consult legal and engineering experts throughout the process.

**Project Planning and Design**

A Planning Permit is required from local authorities before development begins, including approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for Design Approval, ensuring compliance with building codes and environmental standards.

**Licensing and Construction**

A Building Permit must be obtained from the municipality or relevant authority after design approval, confirming adherence to building regulations. Periodic Quality Inspections during construction may be required to verify compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Land Laws**

Property Verification is essential to confirm legal ownership and proper registration in the land registry, requiring property documents and legal confirmations. Any joint ownership or disputed property rights (Settlement of Property Rights) must be resolved before development commences.

**Environmental Standards**

An Environmental Impact Assessment may be necessary for certain projects to evaluate their environmental effect, potentially requiring approval from environmental authorities.

**Special Licenses and Permits**

Certain projects, like commercial or industrial developments, may require Special Licenses from bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations, including safety and fire protection systems, is also mandatory.

**Taxation and Fees**

Permit and Licensing Fees are applicable and must be paid according to local regulations. Development Taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, may also be levied.

**Post-Development Registration**

Upon completion, the property must be registered in the Land Registry Registration, requiring documents proving completion according to legal specifications. A Compliance Certificate from local authorities confirms that the construction meets permit and legal requirements.

**Land Subdivision**

If the project involves Land Subdivision into multiple plots, approvals must be obtained from relevant authorities, including the municipality and land management office.
