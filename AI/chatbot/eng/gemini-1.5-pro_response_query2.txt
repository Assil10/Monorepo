Obtaining a planning permit from local authorities is necessary before any real estate development begins. This permit signifies approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted and approved. These designs must adhere to building codes and environmental standards.

Following design approval, a building permit must be obtained from the municipality or relevant authority. This permit confirms approval of the plans and adherence to building regulations.  Periodic inspections may be required during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

The land used for the project must be legally owned and registered in the land registry. This may involve providing property documents and legal confirmations.  Any joint ownership or disputes related to the land must be resolved before development commences.

Some projects require an environmental impact assessment to evaluate their effect on the local environment. This assessment may need approval from environmental authorities.

Certain projects, like commercial or industrial developments, may require specific licenses from relevant bodies, such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce.  Compliance with safety and public health regulations, including safety and fire protection systems, is mandatory.

Fees for obtaining permits and licenses apply and must be paid according to local regulations.  Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, may also apply.

Upon completion of construction, the property must be registered in the land registry. This requires submitting documents proving the project's completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities, confirming that the construction meets permit and legal requirements, must also be obtained.

If the project involves subdividing land, necessary approvals must be obtained from relevant authorities, including the municipality and land management office.
