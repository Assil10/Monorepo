Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to specific legal and administrative steps. Before starting, developers must secure a Planning Permit from local authorities, which includes approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must also be submitted for Design Approval, ensuring compliance with building codes and environmental standards.

Once designs are approved, a Building Permit from the municipality or relevant authority is required to begin construction. This permit ensures the plans adhere to building regulations. Throughout the construction process, periodic Quality Inspections may be conducted to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

It is crucial to verify Property ownership before development. Developers must prove legal ownership and proper registration in the land registry by providing property documents and legal confirmations. Any issues related to joint ownership or disputes over property rights (Settlement of Property Rights) must be resolved before development begins.

Depending on the project's scale, an Environmental Impact Assessment may be necessary to evaluate its effect on the local environment and may require approval from environmental authorities.  

Special Licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce may be required for commercial or industrial developments.  All projects must comply with Safety regulations, including installing safety and fire protection systems.

Developers must be aware of applicable Permit and Licensing Fees and Development Taxes, such as improvement fees or property taxes.

 Upon construction completion, the property must be registered in the Land Registry. Documents proving the project's adherence to legal specifications are required. A Compliance Certificate from local authorities confirms the construction meets all permit and legal requirements.  If the project involves Land Subdivision, approvals from authorities, including the municipality and land management office, are necessary.
