Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to several legal standards and permits, including:

**Project Planning and Design:**
A Planning Permit from local authorities is mandatory before starting any development. This requires project plan and design approval based on urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be approved and comply with building codes and environmental standards.

**Licensing and Construction:**
A Building Permit from the municipality or relevant authority is needed after design approval, which includes plan approval and adherence to building regulations. During construction, periodic inspections may be necessary to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Compliance with Land Laws:**
It is essential to verify legal land ownership and proper registration in the land registry by providing property documents and legal confirmations. Any joint ownership or land rights disputes must be resolved before development begins.

**Environmental Standards:**
Certain projects require an Environmental Impact Assessment, which must be approved by environmental authorities to evaluate the project's environmental effects. An Environmental License may also be required for major projects, assessing environmental impact to ensure adherence to standards.

**Special Licenses and Permits:**
Projects like commercial or industrial developments may need specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations, including installing safety and fire protection systems, is also necessary.

**Taxation and Fees:**
Fees for permits and licenses are applicable and must be paid according to local regulations. Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement or property taxes, may also apply.

**Property Registration Post-Development:**
After construction, property registration in the land registry is required, with submission of documents proving project completion as per legal specifications. A Compliance Certificate from local authorities is needed to confirm construction meets permit and legal requirements.

**Land Subdivision Compliance:**
Projects involving land subdivision require approvals from the municipality and land management office.
