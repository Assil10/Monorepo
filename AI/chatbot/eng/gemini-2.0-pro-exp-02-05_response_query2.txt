**I. Project Planning and Design:**

*   A planning permit from local authorities is required before starting any real estate development. This permit involves approving the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.
*   Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, need approval. They must comply with building codes and environmental standards.
*   For large-scale projects, developers might need to submit impact studies covering environmental, social, and economic effects before approval.

**II. Licensing and Construction:**

*   Following design approval, a building permit is needed from the municipality or relevant authority. This confirms plan approval and adherence to building regulations, involving a review of construction plans for compliance with urban and architectural rules.
*   Periodic inspections by local authorities might occur during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards, specifications, work quality, and the approved plans.
*   Local authorities oversee construction projects to ensure they follow laws and regulations.

**III. Compliance with Land Laws:**

*   Verify that the project land is legally owned and correctly registered in the land registry, which may involve providing property documents and legal confirmations.
*   If the land has joint ownership or disputes, these property rights must be settled before starting development.
*   Adhere to the Land Use and Urban Planning Law, which governs urban planning, land development, zoning, land subdivisions, and infrastructure development.

**IV. Environmental Standards and Licenses:**

*   The Environmental Protection Law requires real estate projects to meet environmental standards, protect natural resources, reduce pollution, and promote sustainable construction practices.
*   Some projects require an environmental impact assessment to evaluate effects on the local environment, potentially needing approval from environmental authorities.
*   Major projects might need an environmental license, which assesses environmental impact to ensure adherence to standards.
*   Projects undergo environmental inspections for compliance, covering waste management, use of eco-friendly materials, and protection of natural resources.

**V. Special Licenses and Compliance:**

*   Specific projects, like commercial or industrial developments, might need special licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or Ministry of Commerce.
*   Compliance with safety and public health regulations is required, including installing safety and fire protection systems.

**VI. Taxation and Fees:**

*   Fees for obtaining permits and licenses may apply and must be paid according to local regulations.
*   Development-related taxes or fees, like improvement fees or property taxes, might be applicable. Government regulations impose various fees and taxes for real estate development, including permit fees, property taxes, and public service charges.

**VII. Post-Development Requirements:**

*   After construction is finished, the property must be registered in the land registry. This involves submitting documents showing the project was completed per legal specifications.
*   A compliance certificate from local authorities confirms the construction meets permit and legal requirements.

**VIII. Land Subdivision Compliance:**

*   If the project includes subdividing land into multiple plots, approvals are needed from relevant authorities like the municipality and land management office.
