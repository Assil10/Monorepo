Real estate development projects in Tunisia require specific regulatory compliance.

**I. Project Planning and Design**

A planning permit is necessary from local authorities before starting any development, including approval of the project plan and design, as per urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval, adhering to building codes and environmental standards.

**II. Licensing and Construction**

A building permit is required from the municipality or relevant authority after design approval, along with adherence to building regulations. Periodic inspections during construction are mandatory to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**III. Compliance with Land Laws**

The land used for the project must be legally owned and properly registered in the land registry, requiring property documents and legal confirmations. Any joint ownership or disputed rights must be resolved before development begins.

**IV. Environmental Standards**

Some projects may require an environmental impact assessment to evaluate the effect on the local environment, needing approval from environmental authorities.

**V. Special Licenses and Permits**

Certain projects (commercial or industrial) may require specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Safety and public health regulations must be adhered to, including installing safety and fire protection systems.

**VI. Taxation and Fees**

Fees related to permits and licenses must be paid according to local regulations. Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, may also apply.

**VII. Property Registration Post-Development**

Upon construction completion, the property must be registered in the land registry, with documents proving the project's completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate is needed from local authorities, confirming that the construction meets permit and legal requirements.

**VIII. Land Subdivision Compliance**

If the project involves subdividing land into multiple plots, necessary approvals must be obtained from the municipality and land management office.
