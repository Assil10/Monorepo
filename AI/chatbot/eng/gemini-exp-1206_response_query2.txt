Real estate development in Tunisia involves various legal and administrative requirements. Consulting legal and engineering experts is often necessary.

For project planning and design, a planning permit must first be obtained from local authorities. This approves the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, also require approval and must comply with building codes and environmental standards.

During licensing and construction, a building permit is obtained from the municipality or relevant authority after design approval. This confirms plan approval and adherence to building regulations. Periodic quality inspections may occur during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

Regarding land laws, verification is needed to ensure the property is legally owned and registered in the land registry, potentially requiring documents and legal confirmations. Any joint ownership or disputes must be settled before development starts.

Environmental standards must be met. An environmental impact assessment might be required for some projects to evaluate environmental effects, needing approval from environmental authorities and adherence to the Environmental Protection Law. Major projects could require an environmental license assessing impact and adherence to standards. Projects also undergo environmental inspections for compliance with standards like waste management, use of eco-friendly materials, and resource protection.

Special licenses and permits might be necessary. Certain projects (e.g., commercial, industrial) may require specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or Commerce. If subdividing land, necessary approvals must be obtained from relevant authorities such as the municipality or land management office.

Safety compliance is mandatory, requiring adherence to safety and public health regulations, including the installation of safety and fire protection systems.

Regarding taxation and fees, payments are required for permit and licensing fees according to local regulations. Development-related taxes or fees, like improvement fees or property taxes, may also apply.

Post-development, the completed property must be registered in the land registry. This involves submitting documents proving completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate is then obtained from local authorities, confirming construction meets permit and legal requirements.

Fundamentally, development must adhere to the Land Use and Urban Planning Law (governing zoning, subdivisions, infrastructure) and the Environmental Protection Law. Compliance with local authority Guiding Plans defining land use is also required. For large projects, impact studies (environmental, social, economic) may need to be submitted.
