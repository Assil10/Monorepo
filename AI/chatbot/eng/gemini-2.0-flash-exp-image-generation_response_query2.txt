Real estate development in Tunisia requires various legal and administrative steps.

**Project Planning and Design:**

A Planning Permit is needed from local authorities before starting any development, approving the project plan and design under urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted and comply with building codes and environmental standards for Design Approval.

**Licensing and Construction:**

After design approval, a Building Permit from the municipality or relevant authority is required, approving the plans and ensuring adherence to building regulations. Quality Inspections may be needed during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards. An Environmental License may be needed for major projects, assessing the projectâ€™s environmental impact.

**Compliance With Land Laws:**

The land used must be legally owned and registered. If the land has joint ownership or disputes, these rights must be resolved before development.

**Environmental Standards:**

An Environmental Impact Assessment may be required for some projects to evaluate the effect on the local environment.

**Special Licenses and Permits:**

Certain projects like commercial or industrial developments may need specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations is necessary, including safety and fire protection systems.

**Property Registration Post-Development:**

Upon completion, the property must be registered in the land registry. A Compliance Certificate from local authorities confirms the construction meets permit and legal requirements.

**Land Subdivision Compliance:**

If the project involves subdividing land, approvals are needed from authorities, including the municipality and land management office.
