Real estate development in Tunisia requires obtaining a planning permit from local authorities before starting any work; this permit approves the project plan and design based on urban planning laws. Certified architectural and engineering designs must be submitted for approval, ensuring they meet building codes and environmental standards.

After design approval, a building permit is needed from the municipality or relevant authority, confirming the plans adhere to building regulations. Periodic quality inspections during the construction phase may be required to verify compliance with legal standards and specifications.

The land used for the project must be legally owned and correctly registered in the land registry, which might involve providing property documents and legal confirmations. Any joint ownership issues or disputes over land rights must be settled before development can begin.

Certain projects may necessitate an environmental impact assessment to evaluate effects on the local environment, requiring approval from environmental authorities.

Specific developments, such as commercial or industrial projects, might need special licenses from relevant bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Adherence to safety and public health regulations, including the installation of safety and fire protection systems, is mandatory.

Fees apply for obtaining permits and licenses and must be paid according to local regulations. Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, may also be applicable.

Upon completion of construction, the property must be registered in the land registry. This process involves submitting documents proving the project was completed according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities is also required, confirming that the construction meets the permit conditions and legal requirements.

If a project involves subdividing land into multiple plots, necessary approvals must be obtained from relevant authorities, including the municipality and the land management office.
