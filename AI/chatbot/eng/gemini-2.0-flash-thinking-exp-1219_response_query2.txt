Developing real estate in Tunisia requires navigating specific permits and legal standards. Before starting any project, a planning permit from local authorities is essential, necessitating project plan and design approval that aligns with urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted and approved, ensuring compliance with building codes and environmental standards.

Following design approval, a building permit from the municipality or relevant authority is required, which also involves plan approval and adherence to building regulations. During construction, periodic quality inspections may be conducted to verify compliance with legal standards and specifications.

Crucially, verifying legal land ownership and registration in the land registry is essential, potentially requiring property documents and legal confirmations.  Any joint ownership or property disputes must be resolved before development commences.

For certain projects, an environmental impact assessment may be necessary to evaluate the project's environmental effect and secure approval from environmental authorities. Specific projects like commercial or industrial developments might need special licenses from bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations is also necessary, including the installation of safety and fire protection systems.

Fees apply for permits and licenses, and development-related taxes or fees like improvement fees or property taxes may be applicable.

After construction, property registration in the land registry is required, with documents proving project completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities is also needed to confirm construction meets permit and legal requirements.

If the project involves land subdivision, approvals from authorities such as the municipality and land management office are necessary.

Key legislation includes the Land Use and Urban Planning Law, which governs urban planning and land development, outlining land use, zoning, land subdivisions, and infrastructure development. The Environmental Protection Law ensures projects meet environmental standards, protecting natural resources, reducing pollution, and promoting environmental sustainability.

Local authorities create guiding plans defining land use zones, including residential, commercial, industrial, and public spaces. Large-scale projects may require impact studies assessing environmental, social, and economic effects.

Throughout construction, local authorities oversee compliance, conducting inspections to verify work quality and adherence to approved plans. Environmental inspections also occur to check compliance with environmental standards, including waste management and the use of eco-friendly materials.
