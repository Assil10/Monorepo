Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to several permits and legal standards.

**Project Planning and Design:** A planning permit is needed from local authorities, along with approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval, ensuring compliance with building codes and environmental standards.

**Licensing and Construction:** A building permit is required from the municipality or relevant authority after design approval, with plans adhering to building regulations. Periodic quality inspections during construction ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Land Laws:** Legal ownership and proper registration of the land in the land registry must be verified, providing property documents and legal confirmations. Any joint ownership or disputed land rights should be resolved before development begins.

**Environmental Standards:** An environmental impact assessment may be necessary for certain projects to evaluate their environmental effect.

**Special Licenses and Permits:** Commercial or industrial projects may require specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations, including safety and fire protection systems, is also mandatory.

**Post-Development Registration:** Upon completion, the property must be registered in the land registry, submitting documents proving completion according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities confirming adherence to permit and legal requirements is also needed.

**Land Subdivision:** If subdividing land, approvals are required from the municipality and land management office.
