Planning permits must be obtained from local authorities, requiring approval of project plans and designs according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval and must comply with building codes and environmental standards.

A building permit from the municipality is needed after design approval, contingent on plan approval and adherence to building regulations.  Periodic quality inspections during construction ensure compliance with legal standards.

Legal ownership and proper land registration must be verified, requiring property documents and legal confirmations.  Any joint ownership or property rights disputes must be resolved before development begins.

An environmental impact assessment may be required for some projects, necessitating approval from environmental authorities.

Specific licenses from relevant bodies (e.g., the Ministry of Industry or Commerce) are needed for commercial or industrial projects.  Safety and public health regulations must be followed, including installing safety and fire protection systems.

Permit and licensing fees, along with development-related taxes (e.g., improvement fees or property taxes), must be paid.

After construction, the property must be registered in the land registry, providing documents proving legal compliance. A compliance certificate confirming that construction meets permit and legal requirements must be obtained from local authorities.

If the project involves land subdivision, approvals from the municipality and land management office are required.

Adherence to land use and urban planning laws is mandatory, encompassing zoning, land subdivisions, and infrastructure development regulations.  Environmental protection laws must be followed to ensure compliance with environmental standards.  Building permits, obtained from local authorities, require construction plan review for compliance with urban and architectural regulations.  An environmental license may be required for major projects, assessing its environmental impact.  Local authorities' guiding plans defining land use must be followed.  Impact studies, covering environmental, social, and economic effects, are required for large-scale projects.  Local authorities monitor construction projects through periodic inspections.  Inspections ensure compliance with environmental standards (waste management, eco-friendly materials, and protection of natural resources).  Large projects may require financial guarantees or securities.  Permit fees, property taxes, and public service charges must be paid.
