Real estate development in Tunisia requires several permits and adherence to specific legal standards.

Project planning begins with obtaining a planning permit from local authorities, which includes approval of the project plan and design based on urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must then be approved, ensuring compliance with building codes and environmental standards.

Construction itself requires a building permit from the municipality or relevant authority, confirming adherence to building regulations. Periodic quality inspections are often necessary to verify compliance with legal standards and project specifications throughout the construction process.

Depending on the project, an Environmental Impact Assessment may be needed to evaluate environmental effects and gain approval from environmental authorities. Certain commercial or industrial projects require specific licenses from ministries like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. All developments must comply with safety and public health regulations, including fire protection systems.

After completion, property must be registered in the land registry with supporting documentation proving legal compliance. A certificate from local authorities confirming construction meets all permit and legal requirements is also necessary. 

If the project involves land subdivision, approvals from the municipality and land management office are required. 

Finally, before development begins, itâ€™s essential to verify legal ownership and registration of the land in the land registry and resolve any existing joint ownership or property disputes.
