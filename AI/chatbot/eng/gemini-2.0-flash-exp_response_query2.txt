Real estate development necessitates a planning permit from local authorities approving the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, require approval and must comply with building codes and environmental standards. After design approval, a building permit, including plan approval and adherence to building regulations, must be obtained from the municipality. Periodic quality inspections may be required during construction to ensure legal compliance.

It is crucial to verify legal land ownership and registration in the land registry. Any joint ownership or property disputes must be resolved before development. Certain projects require an environmental impact assessment. Commercial or industrial developments may need specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations, including fire protection systems, is necessary.

Permit and licensing fees, as well as development-related taxes like improvement fees or property taxes, are applicable. Upon completion, the property must be registered in the land registry, and a compliance certificate obtained from local authorities confirming legal compliance. If the project involves land subdivision, approvals from the municipality and land management office are necessary.
