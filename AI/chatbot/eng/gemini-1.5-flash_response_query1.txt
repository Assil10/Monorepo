To develop a project, you must obtain a planning permit from local authorities, approving the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Approved architectural and engineering designs, prepared by licensed professionals and complying with building codes and environmental standards, must also be submitted.  A building permit from the municipality is required, ensuring plans adhere to building regulations. Periodic quality inspections verify compliance with legal standards and specifications.

Legal ownership and registration of the land must be verified in the land registry, providing property documents and legal confirmations.  Any joint ownership or disputes must be resolved before starting development.  For some projects, environmental impact assessment approval from environmental authorities is necessary.

Specific licenses from relevant bodies (e.g., Ministry of Industry or Commerce) are needed for commercial or industrial developments.  Safety and public health regulations, including fire protection systems, must be followed.

Permit and licensing fees, along with development-related taxes (e.g., improvement fees or property taxes), must be paid according to local regulations.

After construction, register the property in the land registry, submitting completion documents. A compliance certificate confirming that the construction meets permit and legal requirements must be obtained from local authorities.  If the project involves land subdivision, approvals from the municipality and land management office are required.

Development must adhere to the Land Use and Urban Planning Law, the Environmental Protection Law, and local authoritiesâ€™ guiding plans.  A building permit is necessary, involving plan review for compliance with urban and architectural regulations.  Major projects require an environmental license, assessing environmental impact and ensuring adherence to environmental standards.  Large-scale projects require impact studies (environmental, social, and economic).  Construction and environmental inspections verify compliance.  Financial regulations must be met, potentially including securing financing guarantees.  Fees and taxes related to real estate development (permit fees, property taxes, public service charges) must be paid. Government incentives may be available for environmentally sustainable projects.
