Project planning and design require a planning permit from local authorities, approving the project plan and design per urban planning laws. Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for design approval and comply with building codes and environmental standards. After design approval, a building permit must be obtained from the municipality or relevant authority, including approval of the plans and adherence to building regulations. Periodic quality inspections may be required during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

Land laws necessitate property verification, ensuring the land is legally owned and registered in the land registry via property documents and legal confirmations. Any joint ownership or disputes must be resolved before commencing development.

For some projects, an environmental impact assessment may be required and may need approval from environmental authorities.

Certain projects may require special licenses from relevant bodies, such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with safety and public health regulations is necessary, including the installation of safety and fire protection systems.

Permit and licensing fees may apply. Development-related taxes or fees, such as improvement fees or property taxes, may also be applicable.

The property must be registered in the land registry post-development, submitting documents proving the project has been completed according to legal specifications. A compliance certificate from local authorities confirms that the construction meets the permit and legal requirements.

If the project involves subdividing land, necessary approvals must be obtained from relevant authorities, including the municipality and land management office.

Land Use and Urban Planning Law governs urban planning and land development, outlining land use and the distribution of activities within cities and rural areas, including regulations on zoning, land subdivisions, and infrastructure development. Environmental Protection Law ensures that real estate projects adhere to environmental standards, protecting natural resources, reducing pollution, and promoting environmental sustainability in construction practices. For major projects, an environmental license may be required, assessing the project’s environmental impact to ensure adherence to environmental standards. Local authorities prepare guiding plans that define land use in specific areas, including residential, commercial, and industrial zones, as well as public spaces. Before approving large-scale projects, developers may need to submit impact studies covering the project’s environmental, social, and economic effects. Local authorities monitor construction projects to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, including periodic inspections to verify work quality and adherence to approved plans. Projects are inspected for compliance with environmental standards, including waste management, use of eco-friendly materials, and protection of natural resources.
