To develop a property, you must obtain a planning permit from local authorities, including approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.  Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval and comply with building codes and environmental standards.  A building permit is then required from the municipality after design approval, ensuring adherence to building regulations.  Periodic quality inspections during construction are mandatory.

Legal ownership and proper land registration must be verified, providing necessary documents and legal confirmations.  Any joint ownership or disputes regarding property rights must be resolved before development begins.  Depending on the project, an environmental impact assessment may be required and approved by environmental authorities.  Commercial or industrial projects may require specific licenses from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or Commerce.  Safety and public health regulations, including fire protection, must be adhered to.

Permit and licensing fees, as well as development taxes (improvement fees or property taxes), are payable according to local regulations.  After construction, the property must be registered in the land registry, submitting documents proving completion according to legal specifications, and a compliance certificate obtained from local authorities.  Land subdivision requires approvals from the municipality and land management office.

Development must comply with the Land Use and Urban Planning Law, governing urban planning and land development, including zoning, land subdivisions, and infrastructure development.  Environmental protection laws must be followed to protect natural resources, reduce pollution, and promote sustainability.  A building permit, ensuring compliance with urban and architectural regulations, is necessary.  Major projects require an environmental license assessing their environmental impact.  Local authorities' guiding plans defining land use must be followed, along with the submission of impact studies (environmental, social, and economic) for large-scale projects.  Construction is subject to local authority monitoring and inspections, including environmental inspections for waste management, eco-friendly materials, and protection of natural resources.  Large projects may require financial guarantees or securities.  Permit fees, property taxes, and public service charges must be paid, following guidelines for environmental sustainability and strategic planning.
