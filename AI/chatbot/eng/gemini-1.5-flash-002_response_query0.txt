Real estate development in Tunisia requires navigating numerous legal and administrative procedures.  Developers must consult legal and engineering professionals to ensure compliance.

Before starting, a planning permit, approving the project plan and design according to urban planning laws, is needed.  Approved architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must comply with building codes and environmental standards.

A building permit, authorizing construction according to building regulations, is required after design approval.  Periodic quality inspections during construction may be necessary.

Verify legal ownership and registration of the land in the land registry, providing necessary documentation.  Resolve any joint ownership or land disputes before development begins.

Some projects require an environmental impact assessment approved by environmental authorities.

Specific licenses may be needed from bodies like the Ministry of Industry or Commerce for commercial or industrial projects.  Safety and public health regulations, including fire protection, must be met.

Permit and licensing fees, along with development taxes (such as improvement or property taxes), apply.

After construction, register the property in the land registry, providing completion documentation.  A compliance certificate from local authorities confirms legal requirements have been met.

If land subdivision is involved, obtain approvals from the municipality and land management office.  Adhering to these requirements helps prevent legal problems and streamlines the development process.
