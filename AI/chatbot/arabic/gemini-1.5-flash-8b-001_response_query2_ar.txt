To begin any real estate development project in Tunisia, local authorities' approval (planning permit) is required.  Approved architectural and engineering designs from licensed professionals are needed for design approval.  A building permit from the municipality or relevant authority is necessary after design approval.  Specific permits may be needed for commercial or industrial projects from relevant bodies.  Environmental impact assessments may be required for some projects.  Government approval is crucial for land acquisition.  Any shared or disputed ownership rights must be resolved.  Ensure the land is legally owned and correctly registered.  If the project involves land division, necessary approvals are required.
