Developers must consult with legal and engineering experts to ensure all requirements are met and the necessary permits are obtained. Compliance with these requirements can help avoid legal issues and expedite the development process.

**Project Planning and Design:**

- **Planning Permit:** Before starting any real estate development project, it is essential to obtain a permit from the local authorities. This permit includes approval of the project plan and design in accordance with urban planning laws.
