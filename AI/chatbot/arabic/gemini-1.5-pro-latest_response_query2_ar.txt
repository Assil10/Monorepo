Before starting any real estate development project, obtaining a planning permit from local authorities is essential. This permit signifies approval of the project plan and design, in accordance with urban planning laws.

Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval. These designs must comply with building codes and environmental standards.

Following design approval, a building permit must be obtained from the municipality or relevant authority. This permit includes approval of the blueprints and adherence to building regulations.

Environmental impact assessment approval from environmental authorities is required, if applicable.

Specific licenses from relevant bodies, such as the Ministry of Industry or Ministry of Commerce, may be required for certain projects, like commercial or industrial ventures.

A certificate of compliance from local authorities confirms that the construction meets permit and legal requirements.

Necessary approvals for land division must be obtained from relevant authorities, including the municipality and the Land Management Office, if the project involves land division.

Government approval for land purchase is also required.
