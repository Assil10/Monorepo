Licensing and construction require a building permit from the municipality or relevant authority, approving plans and adherence to building regulations. Periodic quality inspections during construction may be needed to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

Land law compliance includes verifying legal ownership and proper registration of land in the land registry, potentially requiring ownership documents and legal assurances. Resolving shared ownership or disputes over intellectual property rights must occur before development.

Environmental standards may necessitate an environmental impact assessment for certain projects to evaluate effects on the local environment, potentially requiring approval from environmental authorities.

Special licenses and permits may be needed for specific projects, like commercial or industrial ones, from relevant bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with public health and safety rules is essential, including installing safety and fire protection systems.
