Real estate development in Tunisia requires several permits and approvals:

*   **Planning Permit:** Required from local authorities before starting any development project. This approves the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.
*   **Design Approval:** Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval. Designs must comply with building codes and environmental standards.
*   **Building Permit:** After design approval, a building permit must be obtained from the municipality or relevant authority. This includes approval of plans and compliance with building regulations.
*   **Environmental Impact Assessment:** Some projects may require an environmental impact assessment to evaluate their effect on the local environment and may require approval from environmental authorities.
*   **Special Licenses:** Certain projects, like commercial or industrial ones, may need specific licenses from relevant bodies, such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce.
*   **Land Division:** If the project involves dividing land into multiple plots, necessary approvals are needed from relevant authorities, including the municipality and land management office.
*   **Government Approval:** Securing government approval is essential when purchasing land, ensuring the transaction complies with local laws. This requires submitting an application for approval, which the government will carefully review.
