Developing real estate in Tunisia requires obtaining several licenses and approvals:

* **Planning Permit:** From local authorities, approving the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.
* **Design Approval:** For architectural and engineering designs, approved by licensed professionals, ensuring compliance with building codes and environmental standards.
* **Building Permit:** From the municipality or relevant authority, following design approval, including approval of plans and adherence to building regulations.
* **Environmental Authority Approval:** For some projects, an environmental impact assessment is required.
* **Special Licenses:** Some projects (e.g., commercial or industrial) may require specific licenses from entities such as the Ministry of Industry or Commerce.
* **Land Subdivision Approvals:** If the project involves subdividing land, approvals are needed from the municipality and land management office.
* **Government Approval:**  To secure land purchase, ensuring compliance with local laws.

Furthermore, you must verify ownership and settle property rights before development begins, and comply with public health and safety regulations.  After construction, property registration in the land registry and obtaining a conformity certificate are necessary.
