Before starting any real estate development project, a permit from local authorities is necessary. This permit includes approval of the project plan and design according to urban planning laws. Approved architectural and engineering designs from licensed professionals must be submitted for approval. Following design approval, a building permit must be obtained from the municipality or relevant authority. Governmental approval is a crucial step in securing land purchase in Tunisia. Some projects may require specific licenses from relevant bodies. A certificate of conformity from local authorities confirms the construction meets licensing and legal requirements. If the project involves dividing land into multiple plots, the necessary approvals from concerned parties must be obtained.
