To begin any real estate development project, obtaining permission from local authorities is essential. Approved architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed specialists, must be submitted for approval. Following design approval, a building permit is required from the municipality or relevant authority. Quality inspections may be necessary during the construction phase.

Ensure the land used for the project is legally owned and properly registered in the land registry. Resolve any shared ownership or intellectual property rights disputes related to the land. Certain projects may require an environmental impact assessment. Specific projects may necessitate specialized permits from relevant bodies.

Compliance with public health and safety regulations is mandatory. Fees are typically associated with obtaining permits and licenses. Development-related taxes or fees may also apply. Upon completion of construction, the property must be registered in the land registry. A certificate of compliance must be obtained from local authorities. If the project involves subdividing land into multiple plots, necessary approvals are required.
