Real estate development in Tunisia requires several permits and approvals:

*   **Planning Permit:** Required from local authorities before any development project can begin. This approves the project plan and design according to urban planning laws.
*   **Design Approval:** Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted and approved. Designs must comply with building codes and environmental standards.
*   **Building Permit:** After design approval, a building permit from the municipality or relevant authority is necessary. This approves the plans and adherence to building regulations.
*   **Specific Licenses:** Certain projects, such as commercial or industrial ventures, may require specific licenses from relevant bodies, like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce.
*   **Certificate of Conformity:** Obtaining this certificate from local authorities confirms the building meets licensing and legal requirements.
*   **Land Subdivision Approvals:** If the project involves dividing land into multiple plots, approvals are needed from relevant authorities, including the municipality and land management office.
*   **Government Approval:** Securing government approval is essential for purchasing land in Tunisia.
