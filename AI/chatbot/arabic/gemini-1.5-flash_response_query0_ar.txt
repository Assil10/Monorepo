**Licensing and Construction:** Securing a building permit and undergoing regular quality inspections.

**Land Law Compliance:** Verifying and correctly registering ownership in the land registry, resolving any shared ownership rights or disputes.

**Environmental Standards:**  Conducting an environmental impact assessment (where required) and obtaining approval from environmental authorities.

**Specific Licenses and Permits:** Obtaining specific licenses from government bodies such as the Ministry of Industry or Commerce, and complying with public health and safety regulations.

**Taxes and Fees:** Paying permit and license fees, and development taxes (such as betterment levies or property taxes).

**Post-Development Property Registration:** Registering the property in the land registry and obtaining a certificate of conformity from local authorities.

**Land Subdivision Compliance:** Obtaining necessary approvals from relevant bodies (municipality and land management office) if the project involves land subdivision.
