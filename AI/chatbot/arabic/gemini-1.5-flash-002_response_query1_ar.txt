**Licenses and Construction:** Obtaining a building permit from the municipality or relevant authority, and undergoing periodic inspections during construction to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Land Laws Compliance:** Verifying land ownership and legality, registering it in the land registry, and resolving any ownership disputes before commencing development.

**Environmental Standards:** Conducting an environmental impact assessment for certain projects and obtaining approval from environmental authorities when necessary.

**Specific Licenses and Permits:** Obtaining specific licenses from relevant bodies (such as the Ministry of Industry or Trade) for commercial or industrial projects, and complying with public health and safety regulations.

**Taxes and Fees:** Paying permit and license fees, and development taxes (such as improvement fees or property taxes) according to local regulations.

**Post-Development Property Registration:** Registering the property in the land registry after completion of construction, and obtaining a certificate of conformity from local authorities.
