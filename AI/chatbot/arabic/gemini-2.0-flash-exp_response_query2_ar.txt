Real estate development in Tunisia requires several key permits and approvals:

*   **Planning Permit:** Required from local authorities before starting any development project. It approves the project plan and design in accordance with urban planning laws.
*   **Design Approval:** Architectural and engineering designs, certified by licensed professionals, must be submitted for approval. The designs must comply with building codes and environmental standards.
*   **Building Permit:** Obtained from the municipality or relevant authority after design approval. This permit approves the plans and confirms adherence to building regulations.
*   **Environmental Impact Assessment:** For some projects, an environmental impact assessment is needed to evaluate the project's effect on the local environment, potentially requiring approval from environmental authorities.
*   **Special Licenses:** Certain projects, such as commercial or industrial ones, may need specific licenses from related bodies like the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce.
*   **Land Partitioning:** If the project involves dividing land into multiple plots, approvals are needed from relevant authorities, including the municipality and the land management office.
*   **Government Approval for Land Purchase:** Securing government approval is essential for buying land. This ensures the transaction complies with local laws, requiring submitting an approval request for review.
