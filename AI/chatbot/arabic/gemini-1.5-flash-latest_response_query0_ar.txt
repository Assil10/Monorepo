Real estate development in Tunisia requires adherence to several legal and administrative requirements to regulate the process and ensure compliance with local laws. Developers must consult legal and engineering experts to meet all requirements and obtain necessary permits.  This includes:

**Project Planning and Design:** Obtaining a planning permit and design approval (approval of architectural and engineering designs compliant with building codes and environmental standards).

**Licenses and Construction:** Securing a building permit and undergoing regular quality inspections to ensure compliance with legal standards and specifications.

**Land Law Compliance:** Verifying and correctly registering ownership in the land registry, and resolving ownership rights in cases of joint ownership or disputes.

**Environmental Standards:** Conducting an environmental impact assessment (as needed) and obtaining approval from environmental authorities.

**Specific Licenses and Permits:** Obtaining specific licenses from relevant authorities (such as the Ministry of Industry or Commerce) depending on the project type, and complying with public health and safety regulations.

**Taxes and Fees:** Paying permit and license fees, and development taxes (such as betterment levies or property taxes).

**Post-Development Property Registration:** Registering the property in the land registry after construction completion and obtaining a certificate of conformity from local authorities.

**Land Subdivision Compliance:** Obtaining necessary approvals from relevant authorities (municipality and land management office) if subdividing the land.
