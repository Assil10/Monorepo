* **Building Permit:**  Building license from the municipality or relevant authority, including approval of plans and adherence to building regulations.
* **Environmental Impact Assessment:** (For some projects) An assessment of the project's impact on the local environment, requiring approval from environmental authorities.
* **Special Licenses:** (For commercial or industrial projects) Specific licenses from relevant bodies, such as the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Trade.
* **Government Approval:** (For land purchases) Government approval to ensure the transaction complies with local laws.
